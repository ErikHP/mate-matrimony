Greetings from MATE!

As-salamu alaikum.
My name is Zafar Choudhury, and I’m with MATE. You can connect with me professionally on LinkedIn:

My wife and I founded MATE, an organization that helps single Muslims get married. We are NOT matchmakers—I want to be very clear about that. We don’t do any matchmaking. Instead, we screen and qualify well-educated singles, invite them to live, in-person events, and offer them access to our extensive database. We ONLY work with singles in North America—no overseas profiles are accepted at this time.

My wife and I have been married for over two decades, and we have three children. As educated professionals, we run MATE as a passion project with the support of dedicated volunteers, paid staff, and local imams across the U.S. and Canada. While we are based in Austin, Texas, our chapters are active throughout North America.

Through our live events and online platform, we average three marriages per month, with most participants matching and getting married within 6 to 12 months. Alhamdulillah, our success rate is very high! You can see testimonials, stories, and pictures from successful matches on our Instagram and Facebook pages:

Important Information for Prospective Members

Please read the following requirements carefully, as they will address many common questions:

	1.	Membership Fee
	•	All members must pay an annual fee of $150, which covers 12 months from the date of registration.
	•	This fee provides access to thousands of high-quality profiles and pictures through our app, private Facebook group, Discord server, Telegram, and WhatsApp.
	•	The fee helps cover background checks and operational costs. We previously offered free services but introduced this fee recently to sustain our efforts.
	•	If you’re interested in investing or donating to support our mission, we’d love to hear from you!

	2.	Live Events
	•	Our live events are hosted in various cities and are highly anticipated. Tickets start at $25 and must be purchased separately online or at the door.
	•	While the membership fee does not cover live events, members get early access, discounted tickets, priority registration, preferred seating, and exclusive merchandise.
	•	Parents/guardians/relatives may attend events only with their children—not on their behalf.

	3.	Bios and Photos
	•	Members must submit their bio and pictures within 48 hours of joining.
	•	While exceptions may be made for sharing photos, our data shows that profiles with pictures receive a 67% higher response rate.

	4.	Inclusivity
	•	We welcome individuals of all ages, ethnicities, and backgrounds.
	•	This includes those with special needs, converts/reverts, single parents, veterans, divorcees, and widows.

	5.	Marital Status Verification
	•	Divorced members must be legally and Islamically divorced. We do not accept individuals who are only separated or taking a “hiatus” from their marriage.

	6.	Profile Picture and Name
	•	Members must provide a profile picture and have at least their first name visible to all members.
	•	On platforms like our app, WhatsApp, or Facebook, you must upload a real photo or an AI-generated likeness before gaining access.

	7.	Background Checks
	•	For the safety and security of all members, we conduct background checks, credit checks, and reference checks. Participation is contingent on passing these checks. No exceptions will be made.

If you’re comfortable with these terms, please respond via email - zafarlovesrecruiting@gmail.com - to this message with:

“I accept and I acknowledge.”

We will then begin the process of welcoming you to MATE!

Thank you for your interest in MATE!

Sincerely,
Zafar Choudhury
Co-Founder, MATE
