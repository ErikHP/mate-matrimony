MATE Safety Tips

(Comprehensive Legal Version – Terms of Service Aligned)

Safety Tips

At MATE, we are committed to fostering a safe, respectful, and values-driven environment for Muslim singles seeking marriage and meaningful connections. While MATE implements reasonable safeguards and community standards, online interactions inherently involve risks. These Safety Tips are provided for informational purposes only and do not replace individual judgment or responsibility.

By accessing or using the MATE platform (the “Platform”), you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your interactions with other users, both online and offline.

1. Personal Information Protection

Users should exercise caution when sharing personal information. Do not disclose sensitive or confidential details, including but not limited to:

Home or work addresses

Financial or banking information

Government-issued identification

Login credentials or verification codes

MATE will never request your password or financial information via messages.

2. Platform-Based Communication

For your protection, we encourage users to communicate exclusively through MATE’s in-platform messaging tools until sufficient trust has been established. Communications conducted outside the Platform may limit MATE’s ability to review or investigate disputes or safety concerns.

3. Fraud and Suspicious Conduct Awareness

Be alert to behaviors that may indicate fraud, deception, or malicious intent, including:

Requests for money, gifts, loans, or investments

Claims of urgent personal or financial emergencies

Attempts to quickly move conversations off the Platform

Inconsistent, vague, or evasive responses

4. Prohibition on Financial Transactions

MATE does not facilitate financial transactions between users. Users should never send money, gift cards, cryptocurrency, or financial information to other users under any circumstances.

5. Identity Verification Disclaimer

Although MATE may implement moderation or verification tools, we do not guarantee the identity, background, or intentions of any user. Users are responsible for independently verifying information and exercising sound judgment.

6. In-Person Meetings

If you decide to meet another user in person:

Meet in a public, well-lit location

Inform a trusted third party of your plans

Arrange independent transportation

Leave immediately if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe

7. Respectful Conduct and Islamic Etiquette

MATE is intended for lawful, respectful, and marriage-oriented interactions consistent with Islamic values. Harassment, explicit content, hate speech, coercion, or abusive conduct is strictly prohibited.

8. Reporting and Enforcement

Users are encouraged to report any behavior that violates these Safety Tips, the Terms of Service, or community standards. MATE reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate action, including suspension or termination of accounts.

9. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, MATE disclaims responsibility for user conduct, offline interactions, or damages arising from Platform use. Use of the Platform is at your own risk.
